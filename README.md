Hey I'm Joe. I develop a TS-based web app framework, [Awayto](https://awayto.dev). I'm a consultant/freelance dev-for-hire. Wrote my first HTML 20 years ago; started my first project as an intern 10 years ago; and now I'm here to share what I can! Please send any inquiries to [joe@keybittech.com](mailto:joe@keybittech.com).
