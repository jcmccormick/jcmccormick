Hello, I am Joe. Here you will find projects I create which I use for my own purposes, but are free to be used by others. 

Primarily, I work on a framework entitled Awayto, which is intended to be a quick-start saas platform for freelancers and businesses. There are 2 versions of Awayto, cloud and bare metal. The first version of Awayto is an AWS-based solution (lambda, cognito, s3, rds, cloudfront, cloudformation). Awayto Version 2 is a bare metal deployment (k8s or compose, keycloak, graylog, nginx, postgres, express, redis, hugo-based mkt/landing, react app, turn/stun).

Awayto Verison 2 is currently up as a demo at https://awayto.store and there is no email validation, etc, so you can create a fake account and check it out. Currently working out deployment related bugs, modsec clearances, etc.

As a novice developer, my foundational project was to design and implement an online writing center. Now, I'm revisiting this concept with years of experience and the motivation to create something better. In order to derive functionality for this effort, I develop a platform currently called "wc", modeled on an online writing center. It has things like saas based group organization, rbac, scheduling, voice/video, etc. Wc is the underpinning codebase of Awayto Version 2, and currently supports installation locally and on Hetzner. 

While working on wc, I also came up with my own kind of coding assistant/importable ai tool, Wizard's Apprentice. It provides a small kit of functionality for collecting data on openai usage, prompt design, response validation, and other stuff. It can be run on the command line with npx, or be imported into Typescript projects.

Demos of Awayto and Wizapp can be found on youtube https://www.youtube.com/@awayto5530.
