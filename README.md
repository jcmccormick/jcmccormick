Hello, I am Joe. Here you will find projects I create which I use for my own purposes, but are free to be used by others. 

I work on a project entitled Awayto. It's a framework I wanted to make to use for myself as a freelancer, and also as the basis for my own online business projects. [Awayto Exchange](https://awayto.exchange) is the first of such projects; it's a site where users can form groups, design services and schedules, and perform these services intra-group. For example a writing center offering tutoring services to its students. The Awayto project has been in development for some years now, gone through many changes and a few rewrites, and is currently on its 3rd major version. Guide-style documentation can be found at [Awayto.dev](https://awayto.dev).
